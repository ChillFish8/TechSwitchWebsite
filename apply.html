                <h2>What we teach</h2>
                <p>The TechSwitch programme, designed by industry-leading engineers, will teach you all the skills you
                    need to contribute to a wide range of projects. Software development is the main focus and we’ll
                    cover the most popular languages in use at the moment – but it doesn’t stop there. You’ll learn how
                    to plan and design solutions, manage projects, and test code effectively. TechSwitchers also gain
                    experience deploying, monitoring and upgrading software – a vital part of turning great ideas into
                    software that improves the world.</p>

                <h2>How we teach</h2>
                <p>Our 12-week bootcamp gives you the opportunity to work on a number of short projects and training
                    exercises, increasing in scale and complexity over the course of the programme. We have very low
                    student-to-coach ratios, which means you’ll get lots of one-on-one attention from an expert software
                    developer. We like to work in small groups, collaboratively solving difficult problems and having
                    lots of fun on the way!</p>
