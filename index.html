            <p class="medium-width-text black-text">
                At TechSwitch we find promising individuals who are motivated to move into tech and train them as junior
                software developers to be deployed into development teams.</p>

                <p class="medium-width-text black-text">   
                Our mission is to diversify the tech industry, so our training is completely free and anyone can apply
                regardless of their age, employment history or level of education. </p>

                <p class="medium-width-text black-text">
                Following the bootcamp, TechSwitchers are offered 18-month placements with our partners, providing them
                with their first role in software developments and the placement company with an opportunity to get to
                know them with the option to hire them from us permanently. </p>

                    <h2>Break into tech</h2>
                    <p>You donâ€™t need to have been coding for years or have studied computer science to be a great
                        software
                        developer. If you love to learn and problem-solve then you could be a great developer too!</p>
                    <p>If you have gained skills and experience in previous roles, you bring something extra to the
                        table.
                        As a developer, you may have more dimensions than someone who went through a traditional route
                        into
                        coding.</p>

                        From
                        learning the skills necessary to be a confident coder, to finding employment after completing

                        course, we will be there every step of the way.</p>
                    <p>Every learner has a dedicated trainer responsible for their well-being. They provide stability
                        and

                    <h3>Are there any necessary qualifications?</h3>
                    <p>No! If you have done some hobby coding in your spare time that might help you find your feet
                        quicker
                        but it definitely isn't necessary.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>How long is the bootcamp?</h3>
                    <p>The course consists of 12 weeks of training, followed by an 18-month job placement industry with
                        the option of making that a permanent role.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Do you need any previous coding experience?</h3>
                    <p>No! No previous experience is required. We will provide all the training you need to become a
                        confident software developer. </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>What are the hours and where is it?</h3>
                    <p> The course is full-time (Mon-Fri, roughly 10am-4pm). The initial 12-week bootcamp is normally
                        based in
                        our offices in north London but we have since made the course remote to protect our staff and
                        learners.</p>
