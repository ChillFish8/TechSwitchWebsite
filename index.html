            <p class="significant-text-block">
                At TechSwitch, we identify promising individuals who are motivated to move into tech and provide them
                with training to become Junior Software Developers.</p>

            <p class="significant-text-block">
                Our mission is to close the diversity gap and make tech careers more accessible so our training is
                completely free and anyone can apply regardless of their age, employment history or level of education.
            </p>

            <p class="significant-text-block">
                Following the bootcamp, TechSwitchers are offered placements with our Hiring Partners, securing them
                their first role in software development as well as providing the placement company with the opportunity
                to evaluate them prior to hiring permanently.</p>

                    <p>We see potential, not experience. Our applicants don’t need to have been coding for years or have
                        studied computer science to become great Software Developers. </p>
                    <p>By gaining skills and experience in other industries and roles, they bring something extra to the
                        table. As a developer, they have more dimensions than someone who went through a traditional
                        route into coding.</p>

                    <p>We know that software development isn’t just about languages. Our training provides the
                        foundations to make sure our learners are able to apply their skills to any language in the
                        future. </p>
                    <p>Learners are also taught best-practice techniques to make sure they immediately fit right into
                        any development team.</p>

                    <h3>Are there any necessary qualifications?</h3>
                    <p>No! If you have done some hobby coding in your spare time that might help you find your feet
                        quicker
                        but it definitely isn't necessary to apply.</p>

                    <h3>How long is the bootcamp?</h3>
                    <p>The course consists of 12 weeks of training, followed by an 18-month job placement in industry
                        with
                        the option of making that a permanent role.</p>

                    <h3>Do you need any previous coding experience?</h3>
                    <p>No! No previous experience is required. We will provide all the training you need to become a
                        confident software developer. This starts with learning some JavaScript during the application
                        process.</p>

                    <h3>What are the hours and where is it?</h3>
                    <p> The course is full-time (Weekdays 10am-4pm). The initial 12-week bootcamp is normally based in
                        our offices in north London but we have since made the course remote to protect our staff and
                        learners.</p>
