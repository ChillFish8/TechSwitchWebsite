                    <p>We don't think you need to have been coding for years or studied computer science to be a great software developer! If you love to learn and problem solve then you could be a great developer too!</p>
                    <p>The skills and experience you have gained in previous roles allow you to bring something extra to the table and give you  more dimension as a developer than someone who went though a more "traditional" route into coding.</p>

                    The best thing about the course is that it is solely focused on teaching and training us, not about how much I already knew or had done. I didn’t have any prior knowledge on programming or coding, but they saw I was smart, good at logical thinking and a fast learner and they taught me the rest through a 12 week bootcamp.

                    Rather than drip-feeding you an answer, you’re encouraged to think for yourself to come up with your own ideas and improve your own skills. It’s likely that you’ll make a few mistakes along the way, but the excellent mentors help guide you towards a sensible solution. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to get into the software development industry.
