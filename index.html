                <h2>Break into tech</h2>
                <p>You donâ€™t need to have been coding for years or have studied computer science to be a great software
                    developer. If you love to learn and problem-solve then you could be a great developer too!</p>
                <p>If you have gained skills and experience in previous roles, you bring something extra to the table.
                    As a developer, you may have more dimensions than someone who went through a traditional route into
                    coding.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Are there any necessary qualifications?</h3>
                <p>No! If you have done some hobby coding in your spare time that might help you find your feet quicker
                    but it definitely isn't necessary.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How long is the course?</h3>
                <p>The course consists of 12 weeks of training, followed by an 18-month job placement in industry with
                    the option of making that a permanent role.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Do you need any previous coding experience?</h3>
                <p>No! No previous experience is required. We will provide all the training you need to become a
                    confident software developer. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What are the hours and where is it?</h3>
                <p> The course is full-time (Mon-Fri, roughly 9:30am-5:30pm). The initial 12-week bootcamp is based in
                    our offices in north London.</p>
