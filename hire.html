                <h2>Versatility</h2>
                <p>Most businesses require staff that can understand the full lifecycle, and transition between
                    different roles when needed. Managing a small project, setting up a CI pipeline, designing a new
                    page, writing high quality code, system-testing a product – we’d expect our technical staff to be
                    able to do any of these. It makes resourcing much easier if your staff are multi-dimensional. We
                    believe in truly cross-functional teams, and that comes from a diverse skill set – built on a
                    foundation of excellence in software engineering. </p>

                <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
                <p>Soft skills can make a huge difference to how successful delivery team members are. We select
                    candidates not merely on their potential as developers but what other expertise they bring to the
                    table. And we consider it an essential part of training to bring out the best in people in all areas
                    and to help them instill good habits. This is all achieved by better diversity of recruitment –
                    something we take very seriously, and have strong supporting networks to help with.</p>

                <h2>Genuine Understanding</h2>
                <p>As a developer, it’s far more important to understand the fundamental principles of software
                    development than it is to know exactly how to do any one particular task. Everyone has access to
                    resources such as Stack Overflow but those resources won’t usually help explain the big picture, or
                    why one approach might be better than another. The most valuable employees are the ones who
                    understand the objectives and requirements – even the ones that aren’t made explicit - and can use
                    their own judgement and experience as they research the best way of implementing the detail.</p>
