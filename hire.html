                We have taken Softwire's 19 years of experience training graduates to be outstanding software developers and applied them to a new generation of skilled, motivated individuals wishing to break into the world of tech.

                        <h2>Versatility</h2>
                        <p>Most businesses require staff that can understand the full lifecycle, and transition between different roles as required.  Managing a small project, setting up a CI pipeline, designing a new page, writing high quality code, system testing a product – we’d expect our technical staff to be able to do any of those, and it makes resourcing far more difficult if all of your staff are one-dimensional.  We believe in truly cross-functional teams, and that comes from a diverse skill set. All that being said, the core competency/role is still Software Engineer!</p>

                        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
                        <p>Seems small, but makes a huge difference to how successful delivery team members are.  We don't just select candidates based on their potential as a developer but what other expertise they can bring to the table. That being said, we consider it an essential part of training to bring out the best in people and install some great habits.  This is all achieved by better diversity of recruitment – something we take very seriously, and have strong supporting networks to help with.</p>

                        <h2>Genuine Understanding</h2>
                        <p>The understanding is far more important than the ability to recall exactly how to do X or Y from the top of your head. Everyone has access to Stack Overflow, Google, etc. whilst they work, but those tools aren’t good at explaining the big picture, or why particular approaches are better than others.  The most valuable employees are the ones who understand the objectives, understand requirements that might not be explicitly listed, and can use their own judgement and experience to research the best way of implementing the detail.</p>

                    The best thing about the course is that it is solely focused on teaching and training us, not about how much I already knew or had done. I didn’t have any prior knowledge on programming or coding, but they saw I was smart, good at logical thinking and a fast learner and they taught me the rest through a 12 week bootcamp.

                    The teaching was done by professionals who really knew what they were talking about and were super helpful. The tasks that we were given to do were fun and challenging with a good learning curve.

                    Rather than drip-feeding you an answer, you’re encouraged to think for yourself to come up with your own ideas and improve your own skills. It’s likely that you’ll make a few mistakes along the way, but the excellent mentors help guide you towards a sensible solution. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to get into the software development industry.
