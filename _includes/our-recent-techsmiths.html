            The best thing about the course is that it is solely focused on teaching and training us, not about how much I already knew or had done. I didn’t have any prior knowledge on programming or coding, but they saw I was smart, good at logical thinking and a fast learner and they taught me the rest through a 12-week bootcamp.

            The teaching was carried out by professionals who really knew what they were talking about and were super helpful. The tasks we were given to do were fun and challenging with a good learning curve.

            Rather than feeding you answers, you’re encouraged to think for yourself to come up with your own ideas and improve your own skills. It’s likely that you’ll make a few mistakes along the way, but the excellent mentors guide you towards a sensible solution. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to get into the software development industry.
